### 1. (15 points)
Assume that \(f\) is a periodic function with period \(2\pi\). Considering the integration \(I(f) = \int_0^{2\pi} f(x) dx\), prove the following statements on the order of convergence of composite trapezoidal rule: \(ITr_h(f) = h \sum_{i=1}^n f(i \cdot h)\), where \(h = 2\pi/n\).

(i) Assume further that \(f \in C^m([0, 2\pi])\), prove that the above rule achieves \(m\)-th order convergence, i.e. \(\exists C > 0\) s.t.
\[ |I(f) - ITr_h(f)| \leq C \cdot h^m. \]
(ii) Assume further that \(f\) is analytic, prove that the above rule achieves exponential convergence.

### 2. (15 points)
Let \(f\) be a continuous function that is \(C^m (m \geq 1)\), such that \(f(\alpha) = f^{(1)}(\alpha) = \dots = f^{(m-1)}(\alpha) = 0\) and \(f^{(m)}(\alpha) \neq 0\). Answer the following questions:

(i) If \(m = 1\), i.e. \(\alpha\) is a simple zero of the function \(f\), prove that there exists a neighborhood of \(\alpha\): \(D(\alpha, \delta) = \{x : |x - \alpha| \leq \delta\}\), s.t. \(\forall x_0 \in D(\alpha, \delta)\), the sequence generated by Newton’s iteration converges to \(\alpha\), and the rate of convergence is quadratic.

(ii) If \(m > 1\), i.e. \(\alpha\) is a zero with multiplicity greater than 1, what is the rate of convergence of Newton’s iteration? How about the modified Newton’s iteration:
\[ x_{k+1} = x_k - m \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}? \]
Please prove your results.

(iii) If the multiplicity \(m\) is greater than 1 in general but the value is unknown, can you propose an iteration method that achieves superlinear convergence? (You don’t need to prove the result.)

### 3. (20 points)
The Sherman-Morrison formula (or the generalized version named Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula) is a useful tool in numerical linear algebra. It states: if \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is an invertible matrix, \(u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n\) are two vectors satisfying \(1 + v^T A^{-1} u \neq 0\), then the matrix \(A + uv^T\) is invertible and can be computed by
\[ (A + uv^T)^{-1} = A^{-1} - \frac{A^{-1} uv^T A^{-1}}{1 + v^T A^{-1} u}. \]

(i) Prove the above statement.

(ii) If \(\{s_j\}_{j=1}^n\) and \(\{t_j\}_{j=1}^n\) are two sets of points in \([0, 1]\), \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is a matrix defined by:
\[ A_{j,k} = 4n \cdot \delta_{j,k} + \cos(t_j - s_k), \]
where \(\delta_{j,k}\) is the Kronecker delta. \(b \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is an arbitrary vector. Please give methods for the evaluation of \(Ab\), \(A^{-1}b\), and \(|A|\), all with the computational complexity of \(O(n)\).

### 4. (15 points)
For the system
\[ u_t = -v_{xx}, \quad v_t = u_{xx}, \]
analyse the truncation error and stability of the scheme
\[ \frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\tau} = -\frac{1}{2h^2} (v_{j+1}^n - 2v_j^n + v_{j-1}^n + v_{j+1}^{n+1} - 2v_j^{n+1} + v_{j-1}^{n+1}), \]
\[ \frac{v_j^{n+1} - v_j^n}{\tau} = \frac{1}{2h^2} (u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n + u_{j+1}^{n+1} - 2u_j^{n+1} + u_{j-1}^{n+1}). \]

---

### 5. (15 points)
For the advection equation \(u_t + au_x = 0\) (\(a\) is a constant), the Lax-Wendroff scheme reads as
\[ u_j^{n+1} = -\frac{1}{2}\nu(1 - \nu)u_{j+1}^n + (1 - \nu^2)u_j^n + \frac{1}{2}\nu(1 + \nu)u_{j-1}^n, \]
where \(\nu = a\tau/h\).

(i) For the Cauchy problem imposed on the real line, show that
\[ \|u^{n+1}\|_2^2 = \|u^n\|_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}\nu^2(1 - \nu^2) \left( \|\delta_x^+ u^n\|_2^2 - \langle \delta_x^+ u^n, \delta_x^- u^n \rangle \right), \]
where \(\|v\|_2^2 = \sum_j |v_j|^2\), \(\langle v, w \rangle = \sum_j v_j w_j\), \(\delta_x^- v_j = v_j - v_{j-1}\), \(\delta_x^+ v_j = v_{j+1} - v_j\).

(ii) Suppose \(a > 0\), for the problem imposed on \((0, 1)\) with homogeneous boundary condition at \(x = 0\) (i.e., \(u_0^n = 0\)), give a simple numerical boundary condition for \(x = 1\) such that the Lax-Wendroff scheme is stable.

**Remark: Choose either 6 or 7.**

### 6. (20 points)
Consider a harmonic oscillator with a cubic damping term
\[ y'' + y + \epsilon(y')^3 = 0, \quad y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0, \]
where \(y = y(t), t \geq 0, \epsilon > 0\).

(i) For small \(\epsilon\), use the multiple-scale method to study the behavior of \(y(t)\) for large \(t\), i.e., construct a proper asymptotic solution.
(ii) Make a conclusion on the validity of your asymptotic solution. Briefly justify your conclusion.

### 7. (20 points)
Let \(K\) be a nonempty closed convex set in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). For any \(z \in \mathbb{R}^n\), define \(\Pi_K(z)\) as the optimal solution of the problem \(\min \frac{1}{2}\|y - z\|^2\), s.t. \(y \in K\).

(i) Show that \(\Pi_K(z)\) satisfies \(\langle z - \Pi_K(z), d - \Pi_K(z) \rangle \leq 0, \forall d \in K\).
(ii) Define \(\Theta(z) := \frac{1}{2}\|z - \Pi_K(z)\|^2\). Prove that \(\Theta(\cdot)\) is a continuously differentiable convex function and \(\nabla \Theta(z) = z - \Pi_K(z)\).
